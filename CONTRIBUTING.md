# How to Contribute

## Open Issues

Welcome all kinds of features requested, bugs caught and enhancement suggestions or anything else.

Just open new [issues](https://github.com/arrowrowe/tam/issues).

## Send a Pull Request

Thanks a lot in advance.

Feel free to fork and send PRs,
only two rules:
no old tests broken, and always 100% coverage.

(We use [ghooks](https://github.com/gtramontina/ghooks) to perform tests before any commit.)
